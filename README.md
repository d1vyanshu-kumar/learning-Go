# Learning Go ðŸš€

This repository contains my journey of learning the Go programming language.

## How to Run

Each directory contains Go programs that can be run using:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Progress

This is my ongoing journey to master Go programming. Each directory represents a different concept or feature of the language.
